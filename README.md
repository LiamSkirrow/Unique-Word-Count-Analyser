# Unique-Word-Count-Analyser
A script that looks through a *.txt file and determines the total number of unique words.

## TODO
- make the file passable via the command line rather than being hardcoded in the program itself
- maybe allow for the reading of pdf files natively? Rather than having to manually convert to txt
- parse a supplied Anki deck (somehow?) and figure out how many unique words are in a supplied text that do *not* appear
  in the Anki deck. In other words... given this/these Anki deck(s) what is my level of vocab coverage in the supplied text?
- print out the unique words in the supplied text that are not present in the Anki deck(s) and...
  - ...stretch task: autogenerate an Anki deck consisting of these unfamiliar unique words
